# Unearthing the Patterns in CU’s Graduate Admission Process

Over the last few years, we have seen a drastic increase in the number of applications that the universities in the USA have received. The field of Data Science has especially boomed during the latter part of the previous decade and has continued to grow at a steady pace. This research focuses on some of the trends seen in student applications over the last ten years and attempts to conclude some of the findings through various hypothesis-testing methodologies. 

The dataset used to generate the findings in the report is provided through the Institutional Research, Office of Data Analytics at The University of Colorado Boulder. The obtained data is cleaned, and exploratory data analysis is done on the same to observe the trends in the data as well as some of the underlying patterns. 

We finally observed that the **admission ratio at the University of Colorado Boulder is influenced by various factors such as the applicant’s residency status and submission of standardized test scores**- which was used to estimate the trends of the entire United States admission process.

### Hypothesis Test Results

#### Analysis 1: 
**Hypothesis:** The proportion of residents getting admitted is more than non-residents for master's degree in the U.S.

**Result:** The analysis revealed that the ratio of residents getting admitted is significantly higher than that of non-residents.

#### Analysis 2:
**Hypothesis:** GRE/GMAT scores have an influence on application conversion even after COVID.

**Result:** The data suggests that the ratio of applicants submitting the test scores getting admitted is higher post-COVID compared to pre-COVID. Therefore, GRE/GMAT scores continue to influence application conversion even after the COVID-19 pandemic.

These findings provide valuable insights into admission trends and factors affecting admission outcomes for master's degree programs in the U.S.
